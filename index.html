            My name is Michael Reiber, I am from Detroit, MI and I go to Loyola University in New Orleans, LA.  I am studying the music industry business.  Someday I would like to become a manager for various artists or work in the marketing field.  I have always loved music, hip-hop and RnB mostly, but I grew up listening to all types of music.  I always used to want to be an artist, but I have recently found a new passion for the business side of things in the industry.  I am creating this short resume to get my name out there and get started in the business.
